        "description": "St James’s Park is hands down our favourite of the famous parks in London. Flanked by Buckingham Palace to one side, The Mall, Westminster and Horse Guards Parade to the others, St James’s Park is a peaceful and picturesque green space covering about 23 hectares. It’s hard to believe that you can find somewhere so quiet in between some of London’s most important spots (it’s also right next to 10 Downing Street) – but that’s London for you. The park is particularly loved by bird watchers, as there is a large lake with two islands within it. Around it, there are various birds including pelicans, waterfowl and duck. \n The sight of the lake, islands and birds certainly makes it a gorgeous sight. If you’re looking for nice parks in London, then James’s Park deserves a spot near the top of your list.",
